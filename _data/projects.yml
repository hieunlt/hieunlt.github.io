  description:
    Wikipedia, the largest and most-read reference work in history, has an API that provides cacheable and straightforward access to Wikimedia content and data, in machine-readable formats.
    I utilized this API to create a simple TUI client that fetches a random Wikipedia article summary along with the link to the full content should it interest the user.
    This project is written in <mark>Rust</mark> using the <mark>cursive</mark> library.

    A simple bot that does all the boring swiping for you because who swipe manually nowaday?

    This project is forked from *aj-4/tinder-swipe-bot*. 
    I extended the original *Tinder* bot to work on *OkCupid* and *Badoo* as well (other sites can be added by creating new subclasses of *Bot*). 
    Originally this was just intended to be a way for me to learn the basics of <mark>Selenium</mark> 
    but then I decided to redesign it using the basic principles of <mark>Object-Oriented Programming</mark>.

    I started this project as a way to learn <mark>R</mark> and as my *final thesis*.
    I learned many skills through this and sharpened my knowledge of <mark>Statistics</mark> and <mark>Econometrics</mark>.
    This project earned the consolation prize of the student scientific research competition *Eureka 2019*, 
    and the article was published on *Vietnamâ€™s Socio-Economic Development (VSED)* Issue 4 Number 104.
