    This project is forked from *aj-4/tinder-swipe-bot*. 
    I extended the original *Tinder* bot to work on *OkCupid* and *Badoo* as well (other sites can be added by creating new subclasses of *Bot*). 
    Originally this was just intended to be a way for me to learn the basics of <mark>Selenium</mark> 
    but then I decided to redesign it using the basic principles of <mark>Object-Oriented Programming</mark>.
